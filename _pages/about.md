Hi, I am a researcher at the [Antenna and Propagation Laboratory] (http://www.ap.ide.titech.ac.jp/), Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan led by [Prof. Jun-ichi Takada](http://www.ap.ide.titech.ac.jp/~takada/index-e.html). This lab is also a part of [Mobile Communication Research Group] (http://www.mcrg.ee.titech.ac.jp/) which is comprised of 7 laboratories researching on different aspects of mobile communications.  

Currently, main research topic is the spectrum sensing for cognitive radio at millimeter wave bands. Specifically, my task is to design the matched filter detector, develop the sensor to detect millimeter wave signals at low SNR, and implement the localization algorithm to detect the location of primary systems.

Previously, I received the Doctoral and Masters degree from the Tokyo Institute of Technology from the same laboratory. I had been working extensively on radio propagation and channel modeling for the wireless system design ranging from 3 to 28 GHz bands. During Ph.D. studies, I played an important role in establishing the collaborative research with the [Department of Antenna, Propagation, and Millimeter wave systems](https://www.es.aau.dk/sections-labs/antennas-propagation-millimetre-wave-systems/), Aalborg University, Denmark, where I worked on analyzing the frequency dependence of multi-path clusters in the indoor environment at SHF bands. Furthermore, I was a guest researcher at the [Electronic Measurements and Signal Processing Laboratory](https://www.tu-ilmenau.de/en/electronic-measurements-and-signal-processing-ems/), Ilmenau University of Technology, Germany, in which I researched on the propagation prediction using ray tracing and diffuse scattering models at millimeter wave bands.
